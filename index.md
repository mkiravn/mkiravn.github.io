# Welcome!

Hello! I am a PhD student in the [Novembre Lab](http://jnpopgen.org/) at the University of Chicago program [Department of Human Genetics](https://genes.uchicago.edu/). You can find my google scholar page [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jCUstA0AAAAJ&hl=en).

I am broadly interested in using statistical tools and population genetics to study the distribution of complex traits in space and time. I also aim to study the intricate relationship between genes and the environment in the modern world, with the hope to make genetic prediction more equitable and accurate. I am also passionate about scientific communication and illustration, and hope to use this platform to share some beautiful science!
