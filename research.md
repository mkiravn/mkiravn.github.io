## Research Interests

Here is a short tour of my research interests:
* **Inherited environments**: in humans, many environmental effects on complex traits are inherited within families, such as dietary habits, access to green spaces and generational wealth. It's often difficult to tease apart these environmental influences from genetic causes. I'm interested in developing methods to use genetic and phenotypic data to quantify the contributions of these to phenotypic variation. 
* **Genealogical linkage disequilibrium**: at small scales, LD is governed by genealogical forces - where mutations map relative to each other on a genealogy. I study from a theory perspective how signed LD results from these forces, and the implications on the evolution of selected mutations. This will help us to interpret patterns of association and allelic heterogeneity at a locus scale. 
* **Spatial population genetics**: I have a strong interest in how geography interacts with population genetics. In a previous project in the Racimo lab which led to [this](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2023/12/19/2023.03.27.534388.full.pdf), I studied how ecological interactions shape population genetic variation; I also collaborate with [Margaret Steiner](https://maggiesteiner.github.io) and use forward in time simulations to study how rare variants spread across landscapes, and the implications for Biobank design.
* **Ancient DNA**: I studied how a haplotype at ADH1B spread through Eurasia during the Neolithic. This haplotype shows strong signatures of selection, and we suspect its spread may have been related to that of farming technologies.
